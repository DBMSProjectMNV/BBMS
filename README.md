## AIM
To make a blood bank database, and to make a web application to interact with this database.

## INTRODUCTION:
To increase the efficiency of blood management in a highly populated country like India, searching and filtering information about various blood banks should be efficient.

## DESCRIPTION:

This system would also allow a blood bank to request blood from other blood banks.
